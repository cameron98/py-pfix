# Py-PFIX

Welcome to my implementation of the [RFC 7011](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7011) IPFIX spec in python.

This project will only act as an IPFIX collector and functionality will not be added to create and send IPFIX records. 


## This Project is not yet complete
This project is still in development and as such, documentation has not been completed.
