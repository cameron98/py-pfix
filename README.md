# Py-PFIX

Welcome to my implementation of the [RFC 7011](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7011) IPFIX spec in python.

This project will only act as an IPFIX collector and will not be getting functionality to send IPFIX records.


## This Project is not yet complete
This project is still in development. Options templates are still to be implemented and data sets received before their associated template are not yet processed. More features will be added shortly.
